      <p>
        Hey, my name is Stav Shaham, I am 19 years old.
          <br>
        I have just started web development for my first time, but I have experience in Java, C#, C++ and more.
          <br>
        I really like Java development, therefore, I am learning how to make website using React JS, Vue, and more, and for the backend I am using Java Spring.
          <br>
        I am a freshman at North Carolina Wesleyan University, and I also play for their soccer team.
