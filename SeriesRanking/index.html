<h1> Stav Shaham's best series </h1>
<h2> My top 3 best series on Netflix </h2>
<hr>

<h3> The Rookie </h3>
<p> The rookie adds both drama and humor. That is why I like it. </p>

<h3> Brooklyn Nine-Nine </h3>
<p>
  Brooklyn is one of my favorites because it is funny. A lot of characters are changing in the series and making serious changes.
</p>

<h3> S.W.A.T </h3>
<p>
  S.W.A.T shows the inside of S.W.A.T. There are a lot of different cases and every case is interesting.
